Hello! I'm Alcahest, a big fan of anime, manga, and video games (although I haven't been playing many lately, unfortunately).

I discovered anime a long time ago—considering I'm 25 now (*Oh God*), I first came across them when I was around 7 or 8 (without realizing they were "anime"), and by 12, I finally understood what they actually were.

From there, I dove straight into the rabbit hole. I've watched so many that I can almost always predict the narrative paths some anime might take.
Years later, I got into the fansub world, and lately, I've been learning new things as well—like timing, for example.

When it comes to non-anime entertainment, Star Trek is one of my favorite series. The Star Trek shows are amazing (except for the latest ones, like that big ʇᴉɥs called Discovery). Among my favorites are Generations, First Contact, Insurrection, and Nemesis.

On this site, I'll be posting anime reviews, recommendations, cool stuff I find on Amazon and want to share, and a bit of shitposting that I don't put on my Telegram channel.

Hope I didn't bore you—enjoy your stay!
